# MPMB v13 content catchup

A community effort to **_unofficially_** transcribe all content missing while v13 is in a content frozen state.

**If you plan on writing additional code for the following sources, PLEASE submit a pull request here when you are ready, so that it can be integrated in with the work everyone else has already done**

PLEASE NOTE: THESE REQUIRE VERSION 13 STABLE OF THE SHEET.

Instructions on how to download and import these files can be found here: https://www.flapkan.com/how-to/add-more-content

The files contained here are **fan-made** js files of the following WotC content, collected from various githubs, reddit posts, and discord. 

This collection is based on the previous compiling efforts of [@smashman](https://github.com/Smashman) and @Nod_Hero#2046. All I (Metacomet10) did was collect the stuff that they had collected together. The hard part, the coding, was done by a bunch of other folks. They deserve all the credit.

The last MPMB content release was February 2020, which was UA Subclasses Part 3. A content freeze was in place after that so that v13 stable could be finalized. Version 13 stable was released October 12th, with v13.0.5 being released October 28th. Shortly after this, MPMB decided to take a sabbatical for personal reasons. There is no ETA for when the sabbatical will be over, however, he has not abandoned the project and will return eventually.
